## Introduction

Prim's algorithm is a [minimum spanning tree](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/spanning-tree-and-minimum-spanning-tree#minimum-spanning) algorithm that takes a graph as input and finds the subset of the edges of that graph which:

1.  form a tree that includes every vertex
2.  has the minimum sum of weights among all the trees that can be formed from the graph





## How Prim's algorithm works

It falls under a class of algorithms called greedy algorithms that find the local optimum in the hopes of finding a global optimum.

We start from one vertex and keep adding edges with the lowest weight until we reach our goal.

The steps for implementing Prim's algorithm are as follows:

1.  Initialize the minimum spanning tree with a vertex chosen at random.
2.  Find all the edges that connect the tree to new vertices, find the minimum and add it to the tree.
3.  Keep repeating step 2 until we get a minimum spanning tree.

## Prim's Algorithm pseudocode

The pseudocode for prim's algorithm shows how we create two sets of vertices U and V-U. U contains the list of vertices that have been visited and V-U the list of vertices that haven't. One by one, we move vertices from set V-U to set U by connecting the least weight edge.

```c
T = ∅;
U = { 1 };
while (U ≠ V)
    let (u, v) be the lowest cost edge such that u ∈ U and v ∈ V - U;
    T = T ∪ {(u, v)}
    U = U ∪ {v}
```





## Implement in C

Although [adjacency matrix](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/graph-adjacency-matrix) representation of graphs is used, this algorithm can also be implemented using [Adjacency List](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/graph-adjacency-list) to improve its efficiency.

```c
// Prim's Algorithm in C

#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdbool.h> 

#define INF 9999999

// number of vertices in graph
#define V 5

// create a 2d array of size 5x5
//for adjacency matrix to represent graph
int G[V][V] = {
  {0, 9, 75, 0, 0},
  {9, 0, 95, 19, 42},
  {75, 95, 0, 51, 66},
  {0, 19, 51, 0, 31},
  {0, 42, 66, 31, 0}};

int main() {
  int no_edge;  // number of edge

  // create a array to track selected vertex
  // selected will become true otherwise false
  int selected[V];

  // set selected false initially
  memset(selected, false, sizeof(selected));
  
  // set number of edge to 0
  no_edge = 0;

  // the number of egde in minimum spanning tree will be
  // always less than (V -1), where V is number of vertices in
  //graph

  // choose 0th vertex and make it true
  selected[0] = true;

  int x;  //  row number
  int y;  //  col number

  // print for edge and weight
  printf("Edge : Weight\n");

  while (no_edge < V - 1) {
    //For every vertex in the set S, find the all adjacent vertices
    // , calculate the distance from the vertex selected at step 1.
    // if the vertex is already in the set S, discard it otherwise
    //choose another vertex nearest to selected vertex  at step 1.

    int min = INF;
    x = 0;
    y = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < V; i++) {
      if (selected[i]) {
        for (int j = 0; j < V; j++) {
          if (!selected[j] && G[i][j]) {  // not in selected and there is an edge
            if (min > G[i][j]) {
              min = G[i][j];
              x = i;
              y = j;
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    printf("%d - %d : %d\n", x, y, G[x][y]);
    selected[y] = true;
    no_edge++;
  }

  return 0;
}
```





## Prim's vs Kruskal's Algorithm

[Kruskal's algorithm](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/kruskal-algorithm) is another popular minimum spanning tree algorithm that uses a different logic to find the MST of a graph. Instead of starting from a vertex, Kruskal's algorithm sorts all the edges from low weight to high and keeps adding the lowest edges, ignoring those edges that create a cycle.





## Prim's Algorithm Complexity

The time complexity of Prim's algorithm is `O(E log V)`.
