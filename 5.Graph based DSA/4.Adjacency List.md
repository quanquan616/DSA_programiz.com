## Introduction

An adjacency list represents a graph as an array of linked lists. The index of the array represents a vertex and each element in its linked list represents the other vertices that form an edge with the vertex.

For example, we have a graph below.

| :----------------------------------------------------------: |
|                     An undirected graph                      |



We can represent this graph in the form of a linked list on a computer as shown below.

|           Linked list representation of the graph            |

Here, **0**, **1**, **2**, **3** are the vertices and each of them forms a linked list with all of its adjacent vertices. For instance, vertex 1 has two adjacent vertices 0 and 2. Therefore, 1 is linked with 0 and 2 in the figure above.





## Pros of Adjacency List

1.  An adjacency list is efficient in terms of storage because we only need to store the values for the edges. For a sparse graph with millions of vertices and edges, this can mean a lot of saved space.
2.  It also helps to find all the vertices adjacent to a vertex easily.





## Cons of Adjacency List

1.  Finding the adjacent list is not quicker than the adjacency matrix because all the connected nodes must be first explored to find them.





## Adjacency List Structure

The simplest adjacency list needs a node data structure to store a vertex and a graph data structure to organize the nodes.

We stay close to the basic definition of a graph - a collection of vertices and edges `{V, E}`. For simplicity, we use an unlabeled graph as opposed to a labeled one i.e. the vertices are identified by their indices 0,1,2,3.

Let's dig into the data structures at play here.

```c
struct node{
    int vertex;
    struct node* next;
};

struct Graph{
    int numVertices;
    struct node** adjLists;
};
```

Don't let the `struct node** adjLists` overwhelm you.

All we are saying is we want to store a pointer to `struct node*`. This is because we don't know how many vertices the graph will have and so we cannot create an array of Linked Lists at compile time.





## Implement in C
```c
// Adjascency List representation in C

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

struct node {
  int vertex;
  struct node* next;
};
struct node* createNode(int);

struct Graph {
  int numVertices;
  struct node** adjLists;
};

// Create a node
struct node* createNode(int v) {
  struct node* newNode = malloc(sizeof(struct node));
  newNode->vertex = v;
  newNode->next = NULL;
  return newNode;
}

// Create a graph
struct Graph* createAGraph(int vertices) {
  struct Graph* graph = malloc(sizeof(struct Graph));
  graph->numVertices = vertices;

  graph->adjLists = malloc(vertices * sizeof(struct node*));

  int i;
  for (i = 0; i < vertices; i++)
    graph->adjLists[i] = NULL;

  return graph;
}

// Add edge
void addEdge(struct Graph* graph, int s, int d) {
  // Add edge from s to d
  struct node* newNode = createNode(d);
  newNode->next = graph->adjLists[s];
  graph->adjLists[s] = newNode;

  // Add edge from d to s
  newNode = createNode(s);
  newNode->next = graph->adjLists[d];
  graph->adjLists[d] = newNode;
}

// Print the graph
void printGraph(struct Graph* graph) {
  int v;
  for (v = 0; v < graph->numVertices; v++) {
    struct node* temp = graph->adjLists[v];
    printf("\n Vertex %d\n: ", v);
    while (temp) {
      printf("%d -> ", temp->vertex);
      temp = temp->next;
    }
    printf("\n");
  }
}

int main() {
  struct Graph* graph = createAGraph(4);
  addEdge(graph, 0, 1);
  addEdge(graph, 0, 2);
  addEdge(graph, 0, 3);
  addEdge(graph, 1, 2);

  printGraph(graph);

  return 0;
}
```





## Applications of Adjacency List

1.  It is faster to use adjacency lists for graphs having less number of edges.
